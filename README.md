## ‚ùì What is this?
With this mod you will be able to dash across your world, using 3 different items! And also, if you are a developer you may use this mod as an `API` to integrate dashing into your project! This fork is created as a way to continue using this mod in future Minecraft versions, I am NOT the original creator, the dashing code was made by [EmaFire003](https://github.com/emafire003/).

## ‚ú® Items
To perform a dash with this mod, you will need to find some treasure first! A **`Dash Globe`** to be precise, and it can be found inside treasure chests from ancient cities, mineshafts and such! (with a chance that goes from a minimum of 12% in mineshafts to 30% in the end city).

Once you obtain the core item, you may craft the actual "dashers" (yeah, I kinda like making puns):

You can dash by right clicking the dasher item.

### `Iron Dasher`
The most basic (yet powerful) item that will let you dash to your next journey, you can craft it like this:

(It will require a `Dash Globe`, `4 Iron Blocks`, 4 Redstone Blocks)

It will provide a decent boost (multiplier of 1) and it has a cooldown of 80 ticks.

### `Diamond Dasher`
The advanced version of the **`Iron Dasher`**, which you can craft like this:

(It will require a Dash Globe, 4 Diamond Blocks, 4 Redstone Blocks) (yes pretty expensive)

It will provide a bigger boost (multiplier 2) with a cooldown of 120 ticks.

### `Obsidian Dasher`
The weird and "reversed" version of the **`Diamond Dasher`**, craftable like so:

![obsidian_dasher_crafting](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29462910/190400323-f01b4d84-f7dd-476d-849c-cf3ad0a1beed.JPG)

(It will require a **`Diamond Dasher`**, 4 Obisidian)

This item will let you do a *backwards* dash, with a multiplier of 2 and a cooldown of 120 ticks (just like the diamond one, but reversed in direction)

![obsidiandashergif](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29462910/190408729-e8e78885-b2e9-4a1e-99e4-85fc27d96788.gif)

Whenever one of this gets activated you will hear a dash sound effect, and see some particles! 

## ‚öô Config & gamerule
To have a stronger dash, you can use the `dashMultiplier` gamerule. This value will be *multiplied* by the default value of the items.

There is also a config file, where you can disable the items entirely and only use this as an API.

## üî® Setup
### üéÆ Users
Download the mod from Modrinth and drop it into your mods folder!
### üë®‚Äçüíªüë©‚Äçüíª Developers
If you want to use the api module of the mod, add it in your build.gradle, using Modrnith's repo, like this:
```gradle
repositories {
    maven {
        name = "Modrinth"
        url = "https://api.modrinth.com/maven"
        content {
            includeGroup "maven.modrinth"
        }
    }
}

dependencies {
    modImplementation "maven.modrinth:fabridash-resurrected:<version>"
}
```
Once you've got the mod implemented into you project, you will simply need to call `FabridashResurrected.dash(Entity entity, float power, boolean reversed);`
The `entity` is the entity that will perform the dash, the `power` is how far it will go and the `reversed` on **true** will make the entity go **backwards** instead of forwards. And that's it.

You could even extract the API module and use it as is, but remember to register the client reciver!

## üìú License
This mod is available under the MIT license, however, it would be greatly appreciated to credit me (DKXLY) and EmaFire003, if you want to use it somewhere.
